					<h2>Creativity</h2>
					

					<p>
	Recently, I was inspired to think more about the creative process after watching a
	<a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/04/12/john-cleese-on-creativity-1991/">John Clease
	talk on creativity</a> and also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01g99j3">the BBC documentary
	<cite>Beautiful Minds: Professor Andre Geim</cite></a>, the discoverer of Graphene. Both of them
	gave me some insights into what makes us creative and potentially how we can become creative.
</p>

<p>
	There was a time when I longed to be more creative but there was an odd connection that my mind had formed
	and I came to realise that I was longing to be more artistic, to be a poet, artist or musician but that creativity does
	not solely exist in these art forms. Creativity, the ability to create something new, is at the centre of scientific
	discovery, the centre of engineering, of architecture and of software development. Each of these fields requires us
	to delve deeply into often complex problems and find solutions, to solve a problem that no one has solved before and 
	to make connections that perhaps other people cannot make. If we contrast working as a scientist compared to working
	on a production line we can see many of the differences, the production line requires us to perform the same repetitive
	where as the scientist will often perform the same experiments again and again but also spends a significant amount
	of time devising the experiments, analysing the data and coming up with a model of the world that fits the results.
</p>

<p>
	However, even within these professions, even within these complex spheres of science and engineering there are
	those who are considered to be creative by their peers, to stand out among the crowd. Are these people actually any
	more intelligent, any more talented, any more creative than those around them or is it something else that makes them
	stand out?
</p>

<p>
	John Cleese pointed out the work of the psychologist Donald W. MacKinnon who is a significant figure in the research
	into the creative mind. MacKinnon did a study of architects, some who were considered highly creative and looked
	into their creativity but what he found was that creativity was not a talent, the people who were considered more creative
	were the people who were more easily able to get into what he calls the <em>Open Mode</em> rather than the
	<em>Closed Mode</em>.
</p>


<h2>
	The Closed Mode
</h2>

<p>
	So, as I said above, thew <em>Closed Mode</em> is where most people live most of our lives. We go to work, 
	there is usually far too much to do and far too little time to do it, we are doing household chores, we are performing
	repetitive tasks, we are responding to e-mail, telephone calls, texts, twitter, facebook and there are many other 
	distractions. Most people will know the complete frustration when you are focussed on solving a difficult problem
	and someone turns up and goes &ldquo;do you have a moment?&rdquo; and the instant they say that you lose
	your train of thought and the moment is gone... you are not disrupted and you might as well answer their question. 
</p>

<p>
	When we are in the <em>Closed Mode</em> we are more likely to find ourselves stressed, under pressure and
	anxious about something. We may also be quite nervous, we are trying to impress, or we are afraid of saying the 
	wrong thing, or looking stupid in front of someone important. The simple fact is that when we are feeling these
	negative emotions we do not really feel creative. 
</p>

<p>
	What happens when someone says to you  &ldquo;Go on, say something funny!&rdquo;? I certainly lose all inspiration 
	about anything funny to say (though there is a debate to be had about whether I actually	have anything funny to say). 
	The reason for this is that, in my opinion, spontaneity and humour are both creative things, the pressure that is put on
	someone to act in that way stifles the process and puts us into the <em>Closed Mode</em>. 
</p>

<p>
	Too often we get stuck in the <em>Closed Mode</em> and too often we find that we are just ploughing on regardless
	and becoming tunnel visioned, maybe even too goal oriented. By focussing solely on the destination and by focussing
	on a single way to get there, we sometimes isolate ourselves from new, exciting and even better ways to achieve our
	goal but we do not take the time to step back and take a wider view. 
</p>

<p>
	However, the <em>Closed Mode</em> does have its uses. The <em>Closed Mode</em> is an active mode, we are more able
	to just &ldquo;get stuff done&rdquo; that does not require any creative input, i.e. fairly linear/repetative tasks, or tasks that
	simply apply following specific rules, in fact the creative mind would impede this process. A creative mind is more
	likely to say &ldquo;I wonder what would happen if...?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Surely this can't be right...&rdquo; and 
	goes off on wild tangents and gets distracted by creativity. 
</p>

<h2>
	The Open Mode
</h2>

<p>
	In order for us to be creative we need to be in the <em>Open Mode</em>. When we are in the open mode we
	are free from the distractions of our daily lives, we are free to concentrate on a particular problem space, we are 
	free from the pressures of all of the work that must get done and therefore we are far more relaxed. I think that when
	we are dealing with complexity, with a problem, we should be aiming to spend some of our time in the <em>Open Mode</em>
	to allow ourselves to become more creative and to come up with more innovative solutions to that problem.
</p>

<p>
	As Andre Geim said in the documentary:
</p>

<blockquote>
	When you are travelling on rails it is very difficult to find something new. When you make forays into new areas you
	increase the chance of finding something new.
</blockquote>

<p>
	What Andre is saying here is really that while we are in the <em>Closed Mode</em> we are very narrowly focussed
	and unlikely to see the wider view. When we are in the <em>Open Mode</em> we are much more likely to engage
	in what I will call <em>Play</em> where we will try new and unexpected things, we will increase the chances of finding
	a connection that we did not know before, we are open to new discoveries, we are being creative. 
</p>

<p>
	If we <em>play</em> around an idea we have to have the confidence, the freedom, the relaxation to be able to make
	mistakes, to be able to fail and to try out even random things, try out impossibilities and use them to discover entirely new
	possibilities. In <em>play</em> we are curious, relaxed and confident, we may be playing with a particular problem
	space but we are not tunnel visioned.
</p>

<h2>
	Final Thoughts...
</h2>

<p>
	When we have a problem I think that often, especially as adults, we rush headlong into the problem and grind away until
	we have managed to make it go away and we do this is us in the <em>Closed Mode</em>. However, to find a creative
	solution to the problem we have to relax, we have to get ourselves into the <em>Open Mode</em> and then we can
	explore the possibilites that are available to us and come up with a solution to our problem. Once we have a solution, we should
	go back into the <em>Closed Mode</em> and implement that solution away from the creative doubts that the <em>Open
	Mode</em> would undoubtedly bring.
</p>

<p>
	Over the next few weeks I hope to be releasing some more blog posts around this subject delving a bit deeper into the 
	techniques and tools that we can use to help us become more creative... stay tuned.
