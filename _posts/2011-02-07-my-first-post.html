summary: In this post I will start talking about how I started using github pages to build a new blog
---

<p>
	For a while I have been using WordPress to host my blog but recently I have just become a bit 
	disappointed with the way in which I felt I had less control over the page than I would like. I
	know that there is a lot of flexibility and power within WordPress but it was just something
	else that I had to learn just to maintain a blog. So, I decided that I would look at
	<a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> which will give me the ability to have more 
	control and also improve my web design skills.
</p>

<h2>Create your github repository</h2>

<p>
	If you don't have an account already then you need to do that first. After that simply create a repository in the format <strong><em>yourusername</em>.github.com</strong> which tells github that you want to use this as a github pages repository. 
</p>

<h2>Generate some content</h2>


<p>And this is yet another</p>

<code><pre class="brush: xml">&lt;html&gt;
  ...
  &lt;div id="github-projects"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></code>
