<h3 id="what_is_programming">Keynote: What is programming</h3>

<p>
	This was a thought-provoking talk about the nature of programming and more importantly about our community.
</p>
<p> 
	Felienne raises the question about welcoming we are compared to other communities, how judgemental we are about
	what constitutes <em>"programming"</em>. As a community we are often dismissive, judgemental, we can
	have a powerful influence on newcomers. Does it matter if someone codes in Excel functions/macros or in Haskell?
	Does it matter if someone uses VB, PHP, C#, Java, Perl, COBOL? We are all trying to solve problems, so we can
	talk to each other, talk about how we solve the problems, learn from each other.
</p>
<p>
	What is also interesting is that through research Felienne has been showing that code quality matters, that even
	for beginners code quality matters, that they are better able to explain and to adapt programs when presented 
	with good examples than poor quality examples. It is possible to teach beginners, even children, about these 
	concepts.

	Jake talked us through the lessons learned from building a new team and redesigning a news website. The lessons
	learned are mostly captured in the sketchnotes but an interesting idea is in the use of a <strong>design system</strong>
	which seems to be a theme that I started to hear throughout the conference. Building a composable set of UI
	components, that bring their own styling so they can be composed quickly and easily.

<p>
	Chris talks us through the concept of DevOps changes how we work, that the knowledge about managing the operations sketchnote_centred_image
	exists all around us, the people who currently do it. DevOps does not necessarily mean that everyone is a specialist at everything, but 
	through working together we can pool our knowlege, that we can help to ensure that we never fail the same way twice, or at least share
	the knowledge of how to respond should the incident happen. 
</p>
<p>
	Alongside the advice about how to handle the resource, Chris shares a word of caution from the "Ops" world, that if we are on call too often
	we run the risk of burn-out. She shares some ideas with us about how to handle burn-out, having a large team on a rota of no more than one week
	to give people time to relax.

<p>
	Suzie is passionate about recruitment, about building a workforce that is more diverse, about changing our processes so that we
	do not discriminate against anyone. I enjoyed the positive tone that Suzie took, rather than finding the faults in a <em>potential colleague</em>
	(I love that term), find the reasons to hire them, and look for what people can add to the organisation than looking for <em>cultural fit</em>.
	Rather than trying to trip up a potential colleague in an interview, think <strong>"let's be smart together"</strong>.

        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image" 
        	src="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/refactoring_to_immutability_small.jpg"

<p>
	Kevlin talked about the combination of mutability and shared state. Originally, mutable state did not cause much of a problem
	simply because only one thread accessed it at a time, it was only when mutable state is shared between multiple threads that
	we end up in race conditions. 
</p>
<p>
	Another interesting factor that Kevlin just briefly touched upon was the orthogonal factors of code:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Functional</strong> - what the application does</li>
	<li><strong>Operational</strong> - how the code runs, how it is monitored, how performant it is</li>
	<li><strong>Developmental</strong> - how easy the code is to develop</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Different operations that we perform on the code affect mostly one area, e.g. <em>refactoring</em> affects the <em>developmental</em>
	factor without changing the other two while <em>optimisation</em> mosty focusses on improving the <em>operational</em> side.

 <h3 id="ethics_of_programming">Code is not neutral: the ethics of programming</h3>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/clarissa">Clarissa Peterson</a></p>

    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/code_is_not_neutral.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image"

        	alt="Sketchnotes about the ethics of programming"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Clarissa challenged the idea that technology is inherently neutral, that our code does not have any negative impact on the world 
	around us. She pointed us to the events around the Volkswagen developer who was imprisoned for helping to hide the true emissions
	results of their cars. Yet, it isn't just the impact of us on helping to do something illegal, what about accessibility? What about
	supporting different languages and cultures? 
</p>
<p>
	What about our systems' security? What would happen if someone hacks your system and gets hold of someone's private information?
	What damage could be done to someone's life with the information you hold? Do you ever put yourself in the shoes of someone trying
	to access your system with malicious intent?
