<h4 id="what_is_programming">Keynote: What is programming</h4>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/felienne">Felienne Hermans</a></p>
<div>
    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/what_is_programming_anyway.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image"

        	alt="Sketchnotes from the keynote 'What is programming anyway?'"

    </a>
</div>

<p>
	This was a thought-provoking talk about the nature of programming and more importantly about our community.
</p>
<p> 
	Felienne raises the question about welcoming we are compared to other communities, how judgemental we are about
	what constitutes <em>"programming"</em>. As a community we are often dismissive, judgemental, we can
	have a powerful influence on newcomers. Does it matter if someone codes in Excel functions/macros or in Haskell?
	Does it matter if someone uses VB, PHP, C#, Java, Perl, COBOL? We are all trying to solve problems, so we can
	talk to each other, talk about how we solve the problems, learn from each other.
</p>
<p>
	What is also interesting is that through research Felienne has been showing that code quality matters, that even
	for beginners code quality matters, that they are better able to explain and to adapt programs when presented 
	with good examples than poor quality examples. It is possible to teach beginners, even children, about these 
	concepts.

<p>
	Jake talked us through the lessons learned from building a new team and redesigning a news website. The lessons
	learned are mostly captured in the sketchnotes but an interesting idea is in the use of a <strong>design system</strong>
	which seems to be a theme that I started to hear throughout the conference. Building a composable set of UI
	components, that bring their own styling so they can be composed quickly and easily.

<h4 id="you_build_it_you_run_it">You build it, you run it!</h4>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisannodell">Chris O'Dell</a></p>

        	alt="Sketchnotes from the power of technical decisions talk at NDC London"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Chris talks us through the concept of DevOps changes how we work, that the knowledge about managing the operations sketchnote_centred_image
	exists all around us, the people who currently do it. DevOps does not necessarily mean that everyone is a specialist at everything, but 
	through working together we can pool our knowlege, that we can help to ensure that we never fail the same way twice, or at least share
	the knowledge of how to respond should the incident happen. 
</p>
<p>
	Alongside the advice about how to handle the resource, Chris shares a word of caution from the "Ops" world, that if we are on call too often
	we run the risk of burn-out. She shares some ideas with us about how to handle burn-out, having a large team on a rota of no more than one week
	to give people time to relax.

<h4 id="be_a_better_interviewer">How to be a better interviewer, change the world and work with amazing people</h4>

</div>

<p>
	Suzie is passionate about recruitment, about building a workforce that is more diverse, about changing our processes so that we
	do not discriminate against anyone. I enjoyed the positive tone that Suzie took, rather than finding the faults in a <em>potential colleague</em>
	(I love that term), find the reasons to hire them, and look for what people can add to the organisation than looking for <em>cultural fit</em>.
	Rather than trying to trip up a potential colleague in an interview, think <strong>"let's be smart together"</strong>.

 <h4 id="refactoring_to_immutability">Refactoring to immutability</h4>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">Kevlin Henney</a></p>

<div>
    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/refactoring_to_immutability.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image" 
        	src="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/refactoring_to_immutability_small.jpg" 
        	alt="Sketchnotes about refactoring to immutability"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Kevlin talked about the combination of mutability and shared state. Originally, mutable state did not cause much of a problem
	simply because only one thread accessed it at a time, it was only when mutable state is shared between multiple threads that
	we end up in race conditions. 
</p>
<p>
	Another interesting factor that Kevlin just briefly touched upon was the orthogonal factors of code:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Functional</strong> - what the application does</li>
	<li><strong>Operational</strong> - how the code runs, how it is monitored, how performant it is</li>
	<li><strong>Developmental</strong> - how easy the code is to develop</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Different operations that we perform on the code affect mostly one area, e.g. <em>refactoring</em> affects the <em>developmental</em>
	factor without changing the other two while <em>optimisation</em> mosty focusses on improving the <em>operational</em> side.

 <h4 id="ethics_of_programming">Code is not neutral: the ethics of programming</h4>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/clarissa">Clarissa Peterson</a></p>

        	alt="Sketchnotes about the ethics of programming"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Clarissa challenged the idea that technology is inherently neutral, that our code does not have any negative impact on the world 
	around us. She pointed us to the events around the Volkswagen developer who was imprisoned for helping to hide the true emissions
	results of their cars. Yet, it isn't just the impact of us on helping to do something illegal, what about accessibility? What about
	supporting different languages and cultures? 
</p>
<p>
	What about our systems' security? What would happen if someone hacks your system and gets hold of someone's private information?
	What damage could be done to someone's life with the information you hold? Do you ever put yourself in the shoes of someone trying
	to access your system with malicious intent?

<h4 id="raspberry_pi">Building a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster and running .NET Core</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">Scott Hanselman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk">Alex Ellis</a></p>

<div>

        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Alex, the creator of <a href="https://openfaas.com">OpenFaaS</a>, which allows people to run anything as a <em>serveless function</em>,
	and Scott were talking about how to build a cluster of Raspberry Pis and use them to run their own cloud of serverless functions. 
</p>
<p>
	It feels like only yesterday that <em>Docker</em> was the big thing but now the world of <em>serverless functions</em> (I still hate the
	term "serverless"). <strong>OpenFaaS</strong> has provided an abstraction layer beyond docker, to take advantage of the power of <em>Kubernetes</em>
	to schedule your functions.
</p>
<p>
	Building your own <em>Raspberry Pi</em> cluster gives you a cheap way to get a decent amount of compute power and they showed us their own
	set-up to more elaborate clusters produced by both amateurs are companies.

<h4 id="what_is_cloud_native">What is this Cloud Native thing anyway?</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/samnewman">Sam Newman</a></p>

<div>
    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/what_is_cloud_native.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image" 
        	src="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/what_is_cloud_native_small.jpg" 
        	alt="Sketchnotes about cloud native"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Sam took us through the birth of <em>Cloud Native</em>, from people running virtual machines on someone else's hardware, <em>Infrastructure
	as a Service (IaaS)</em>, to giving a service the code and they host it on their own virtual machines where they maintain the platform, 
	<em>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</em>. In recent years, <em>Docker</em> and <em>Kubernetes</em> have moved the <em>PaaS</em> world to beyond
	virtual machines and into containers. 
</p>
<p>
	It's not just about being <em>Cloud Native</em>, you can be on the Cloud in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Lift and Shift</strong> - you take your code and run it in the Cloud. Yet, you are sticking to your old traditional paradigms and 
		fighting the underlying Cloud technologies.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cloud ready</strong> - you are still running your code in a way that can be run on your own servers but you are making the
		system in a way that does not fight the cloud. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cloud native</strong> - your code is designed to run on a cloud platform, designed to run in the cloud first, perhaps even 
		attached to a specific platform.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	What about <strong>lock in</strong>? That depends on your business? Are the advantages of the Cloud, of adopting a platform, greater than
	the potential costs of lock-in? Over time, standards may arise, allowing people to switch easily between platforms but these abstractions
	may come with a cost.

<h4 id="windows_based_apps_on_kubernetes">Deploying Windows Container based apps using Kubernetes</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/Ben_Hall">Ben Hall</a></p>

        	alt="Sketchnotes about deploying windows container based apps using Kubernetes"
        />
    </a>
</div>
<p>
	Ben continued the <em>Kubernetes</em> theme of the morning. He took us through the basics of why we would want to use <em>Kubernetes</em>
	to schedule containers on any number of platforms. An interesting concept was the idea of <em>multi-stage builds</em> where we can 
	have a development container and create a new container from that with everything the runtime does not need removed to save space.
</p>
<p>
	Microsoft have produced lighter-weight versions of windows to run in containers, <em>Server Core</em> and <em>Server Nano</em> which
	is 1/20th the size of <em>Server Core</em>. <em>Server Nano</em> is potentially more secure because it can run inside a light-weight
	virtual machine, which <em>Server Core</em> would not. Given how trimmed down <em>Server Nano</em> is, it is more limited, but may
	be more suited the more modern apps (e.g. <em>.NET Core</em> applications).

<h4 id="styleguide_driven_development">Styleguide-Driven Development</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/unicorn_job">Tatiana Kolesnikova</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arvtor">Arvid Torset</a></p>

<div>
    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/styleguide_driven_development.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image" 
        	src="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/styleguide_driven_development_small.jpg" 
        	alt="Sketchnotes about styleguide-driven development"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Tatiana and Arvid talked us through their approach to front-end development. They start by identifying the individual components,
	or <strong>atoms</strong>, things like individual controls (buttons, text boxes, labels, checkboxes). Once the <em>toms</em> are identified
	they minimise the numnber of different variations, to create a simple pallete from which to build more <em>complex components</em>
	(which can be called <strong>molecules</strong>). These <em>molecules</em> are still components, they are still building blocks, but they 
	compose together several <em>atoms</em>. Finally, the <em>molecules</em> and <em>atoms</em> can be composed into <strong>organisms</strong>
	like pages with minimal fuss, 
</p>
<p>
	Both designers and developers work from a component library, the designers build the component library in their own tools, the developers
	in their own frameworks. The designers only work in terms of the components, if a new component is needed then it has to be implemented in
	both.

<h4 id="social_engineering">The psychology of social engineering</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/nmerrigan">Niall Merrigan</a></p>

    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/psychology_social_engineering.jpg" target="_blank">

        	alt="Sketchnotes about the psychology of social engineering"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Niall started by pointing out the techniques that are used by advertisers to manipulate us, how they use aspirational
	advertisements to make their products attractive, or how they use negativity to target your insecurities to make you
	then sell you a solution. 
</p>
<p>
	He points out how <em>anchoring</em> works, that the first thing you are introduced to anchors you and becomes the comparison
	for everything else you are presented with to make the majority of people make a specific choice.
</p>
<p>
	After that he pointed out some of the techniques that hackers use to socially engineer their way into your accounts, or into
	organisations. We are socially engineered to help pregnant women, mothers with screaming children, and some people will use
	that to hack your organisation.
</p>

<h4 id="accessible_forms">Don't be afraid of accessible forms</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/nethermind">Elle Waters</a></p>

<p>
	Elle took us through the basics of making accessible forms. There was a lot of content and I couldn't keep up with the sketchnotes
	so I just focussed on what she was saying. 
</p>
<p>
	At the root of everything there is <strong>semantic HTML</strong>, write the HTML to be meaningful and screen readers will be 
	able to give the right signals to the user. I've been guilty before of styling a <em>link</em> like a <em>button</em> but 
	now I realise that I think a link should be idempotent, it should not change state, where I feel the intent of a button is
	to commit an action.
</p>
<p>
	We should leverage the styling ability on top of existing controls rather than creating <em>custom controls</em>, this is 
	because screen readers know about these controls and how to interact with them.
</p>
<p>
	Beyond that, we should provide all the accessibility hints, such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Labels should link to the appropriate field</li>
	<li>Images should have an alternate text descriptions</li>
	<li>The order of the HTML is important to screen readers</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you get the HTML correct, and the Javascript correct, and the CSS correct, only then should you think about augmenting
	things in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)</a>.

<h4 id="modern_cloud">Keynote: The Modern Cloud</h4>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/scottgu">Scott Guthrie</a></p>

<div>
    <a href="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/the_modern_cloud.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img 
        	class="sketchnote_centred_image" 
        	src="/assets/images/sketchnotes/ndclondon/2018/the_modern_cloud_small.jpg" 
        	alt="Sketchnotes about the modern cloud, by Scott Guthrie"
        />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
	Scott started by telling people that there was so much to learn about the modern web, that things were moving really fast
	and that it is OK to not learn everything. Try to know what is out there, the basics, understand what can be done and then 
	focus on byte-sized learning that takes you where you need to go. 
</p>
<p>
	<em>Serverless</em> and <em>Cloud</em> technologies have been a theme throughout NDC. Computational power is becoming a 
	commodity, it is no longer necessary to run an entire virtual machine 24/7 to process a handful of messages, it is 
	becoming possible to spin up a container, run the required operation and shut down in seconds for a fraction of the cost.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Artificual intelligence</em> is another growing field at the moment, using computational power to provide an intelligent
	and adaptive response to the world around us. We are at the stage where companies are able to make it simpler to categorise 
	speach and images, to combine them with context-sensitive search to produce knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	The power of globalised databases, keeping data local to the user to keep applications fast, with context-sensitive processing 
	of that data (awareness of culture, language, location) and the use of serverless technology opens up a whole new world of 
	potential for software developers.
</p>
