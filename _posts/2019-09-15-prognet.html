<h3 id="future-guardians">Keynote: We are the guardians of our future</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/tessferrandez">Tess Ferrandez</a></p>

<p>
  Tess argued that we cannot be isolated from the ethical impacts of our
  decisions. It is easy for us to say that we are just doing mathematics, that
  we are just applying an algorithm, that it is someone else's job to think
  about the impacts of what we are doing. Even in the world of
  <em>A.I.</em>, as she said
  <em>"if the source data is biased, the model is biased"</em>.
</p>
<p>
  She talked us through a number of examples where the ethical implications of
  our actions can impact people but also how we can improve our processes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build better guidelines.</li>
  <li>
    Provide <em>datasheets</em> for datasets explaining the expected use cases.
    Just as materials come with tolerances, so do datasets, explaining the
    nature of the training data.
  </li>
  <li>Detect, don't predict.</li>
  <li>Keep humans in the loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>

<h3 id="grpc">Beyond HTTP in ASP.NET Core 3.0 with gRPC</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejgordon">Steve Gordon</a></p>

<p>
  Steve talked us through the current changes that are happening in .NET Core
  3.0 to support <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, a high-performance,
  cross-platform RPC framework. The primary ability to communicate between
  platforms relies on an interface specification in a <em>.proto</em> file that
  allows for code-generation of the client and server and allows the message
  contents to be pure data because the metadata is in the contract in that file.

<h3 id="channels">Go Channels in .NET - concurrency made easy</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/trikace">Riccardo Terrell</a></p>

<p>
  Riccardo introduced us to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes"
    >CSP - Communicating sequential processes</a
  >
  and how to use the
  <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.channels?view=dotnet-plat-ext-2.1"
    >System.Threading.Channels</a
  >
  package in .NET while comparing this with the
  <a href="https://getakka.net/">Akka .NET</a> framework.

<h3 id="quantum-computing">Quantum Computing 101</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/djohnnieke">Johnny Hooyberghs</a></p>

<p>
  Johnny gave us a brief introduction to the principles behind
  <em>Quantum Computing</em>, how this is different to the classic computation
  that we are used to. He introduced us to the concepts of
  <em>superposition</em> where in the <em>Quantum</em> world a
  <em>Qubit</em> can hold all possible values at the same time, only when
  observed will the value collapse. Along with <em>superposition</em>,
  <em>Quantum Entanglement</em> is a key concept in the
  <em>Quantum Computing</em>
  world where two particles are linked so that when one changes value, the other
  instantly changes.
</p>

<p>
  He introduced us to
  <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/language/?view=qsharp-preview"
    >Q# by Microsoft</a
  >, which is their simulation of a <em>Quantum Programming Language</em> that
  simulates the <em>Quantum Computer</em> and
  <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com">IBM's Q Experience</a> which is a
  more graphical representation that includes the ability to run on a real
  quantum computer or a simulation of one.

<h3 id="surviving-microservices">Surviving Microservices</h3>
<p>
  by <a href="https://twitter.com/michelebusta">Michele Leroux Bustamante</a>
</p>

<p>
  Michele gave us an awesome, high-content, keynote about surviving the
  transitions to microservices, especially for the medium to large sized
  organisations that have old-legacy code-bases. She explained to us that we
  need to understand why we wanted to do the transformation, that in order to
  prove the value we have to talk in the <em>strategic</em> value rather than in
  terms of the <em>tactical</em> value that we see from our technical
  perspectives.
</p>

<p>
  She went on to talk about the different decisions that we must make along the
  way, that this is a long process that can take a lot of thought and effort,
  that we have to balance design, to re-architect to understant
  <em>eventual consistency</em> and the problems of going through the production
  in a system of complex microservices.

<h3 id="authentication-for-serverless">Authentication for serverless</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/robinem">Robin Minto</a></p>

<p>
  Robin started by explaining how security has changed over the past few
  decades, how moving from a <em>monolith</em> where the identity boundary was
  the edges of the application through to <em>microservices</em> where the
  identity boundary was distributed (or at least multiple identity boundaries)
  and then onto <em>serverless</em> where you don't even have control of where
  the code is running.

<h3 id="pipeline-driven-organisation">Pipeline driven organisations</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/royosherove">Roy Osherove</a></p>

<p>
  Roy talked us through how traditional organisations are partially implementing
  pipelines, individual silos within the organisation (dev, test, security,
  etc), but the pipelines are not connected and require humans to be the
  decision makers.
</p>

<p>
  He argues that in the ideal world we <em>code delegates</em> in a universal
  pipeline, where we allow the pipeline to make the decisions according to the
  rules that we encode.
</p>

<p>
  To have trust in the pipeline we need to be disciplined, we need to "skill up"
  and we need to train the pipeline, when something goes wrong (i.e. when the
  pipeline fails to block something) we have to correct the delegates, or add
  new ones. Each discipline, each silo, needs to continue to produce their own
  delegates and trust the others to produce theirs.
</p>

<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>
