<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Note, you do not need much to start, using simple techniques and a few ordinary pens (one main colour and one highlight colour) you can create impressive sketchnotes. However, if you want to do more, then here are some resources for you.

<h3>Pens</h3>

<h4>Text/Drawings</h4>

<p>For writing I tend to use a set of pens that have ink that doesn't bleed into the page and is waterproof (once dry!) as when applying the colour the ink may run from other pens:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Pens-Pencils-Writing-Supplies/Staedtler-308-SB6P-Pigment-Fineliner-Technical-Assorted/B004L87XRA/ref=sr_1_2?s=officeproduct&ie=UTF8&qid=1496845706&sr=1-2&keywords=Staedtler+pens+set+fineliner" target="_blank">Staedtler fineliner markers</a> are my "go to" pens for this</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Stationery-Office-Supplies/Pigma-POXSDK6-Micron-6-Fineliners/B004AQODNU/ref=sr_1_1?s=officeproduct&ie=UTF8&qid=1496845783&sr=1-1&keywords=micron+fineliner" target="_blank">Pigma Micron fineliners</a> are a good alternative.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Colouring</h4>

<p>The colour is for accent, it does not want to dominate, so often I am looking for something in more pastel shades, more like a watercolour pen, here are some of my favourites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neuland pens are what I currently use, they are refillable and have replacement nibs so I can maintain them well (though never had to!). My preference is for the <strong>brush</strong> tips as I get to easily vary the line width but that can come back to bite you.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Colouring-Pens-Markers/Letraset-AquaMarker-Water-Based-Twin-Marker-pcs/B008DKS5E2/ref=sr_1_sc_3?s=officeproduct&ie=UTF8&qid=1496846027&sr=1-3-spell&keywords=letresat+watercolour" target="_blank">Letraset Aquamarker</a> are good because they come with two different tips so giving you more control for the same price</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Notebook</h4>

 <p>I look for a plain notebook with a decent <em>weight</em> to the paper so that the inks and colours do not bleed into the paper or bleed through as much. I go for <strong>A5</strong> mostly for the convenience of carrying around. Currently I'm using <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artway-Studio-sketchbook-cartridge-hardback/dp/B01B1MCY9K/ref=sr_1_17?s=officeproduct&ie=UTF8&qid=1496846378&sr=1-17-spons&keywords=seawhite%2Ba5&th=1" target="_blank">this notebook</a>.</p>
