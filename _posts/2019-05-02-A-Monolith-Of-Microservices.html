<p>
  Thank you to everyone who attended my talk
  <strong>A Monolith of Microservices</strong> at DDD South West.
</p>

<p>
  I wanted to dispell the myth that a <em>Monolith</em> does not necessarily
  mean that the code has to become a tangled mess and that a microservice
  architecture does not necessarily mean that you are working in a
  loosely-coupled haven. By applying microservice thinking to the
  <em>Monolith</em>, i.e. creating small cohesive areas of code that interact
  via messages, we can create a <strong>Monolith of Microservices</strong> that
  has many of the benefits of both models.
