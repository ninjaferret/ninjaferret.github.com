<p>
  I attended the <em>DDD East Anglia</em> conference in Cambridge. The
  <strong>DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper!</strong> series of events are free,
  community-driven events that are held around the country and on a Saturday to
  allow as many people as possible to attend.
</p>

<h3>My Lightning Talk - Creativity</h3>

<p>
  I have been interested in how to be more creative and I wanted to share a
  simple technique for becoming more creative.
</p>
<p>
  There are several mindsets we can find ourselves in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Open mindsets</strong> are playful, open to new experiences, very
    creative but they lose focus easily and are terrible at getting things done.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Closed mindsets</strong> are where we are focused on getting things
    done, but are less open to new ideas and so less creative.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You need to exist in both the open modes and the closed modes. When we want to
  explore ideas to solve a complex problem we need to be in the open mode, when
  we are trying to implement on the decisions that are made we need to work in
  the closed mindset where new ideas don't distract us from delivering.
</p>
<p>
  To get into the creative mode you cannot be stressed, you can't be worried
  about that e-mail you need to send, etc. so you need to find a time and space
  where you can relax (~90 minutes). A bit of humour goes a long way in helping
  you get into an open mindset. Once there, you need to play with the problem
  and allow yourself to explore tangential areas.
</p>
<p>
  Don't expect ot always find the solution straight away, never leave the
  creative process to the last possible moment, play in advance so that when the
  time comes you have more than just one idea. Even if you don't come up with
  possible solutions straight away, you have seeded ideas and your subconscious
  may well find a new creative solution.
</p>
<p>
  When you're in the closed mode, trying to get stuff done, if you have a
  creative idea don't let it distract you, write it down and come back to it
  later when you have actually delivered.

<h3>The very first computer program</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/marquisdegeek">Steven Goodwin</a></p>

<p>
  Steven talked us through the very first computer program by Ada Lovelace, the
  very first 24 instructions that were written to calculate
  <em>Bernoulli Numbers</em> on the Babbage Analytical Engine.
</p>
<p>
  We discovered that the first program had <em>comments</em> that explained each
  instruction and there were <em>"tests"</em> included in the program (i.e. the
  values expected after each instruction). Though there were only 24
  instructions there was some <em>copy and paste</em> where Ada tells us to copy
  previous instructions to do some iteration.
</p>
<p>
  It was fun to also find out that there was a bug in the program, however, this
  looks to be a bug in the comments. Remember folks, keep your comments up to
  date ;-)
</p>

<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>

<h3>Clouds, microservices and brittleness</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/david_whitney">David Whitney</a></p>

<p>
  David presented us with a lot of his experiences in working with the cloud and
  working with microservices.
</p>
<p>
  What I took away from this was that there is a huge amount to think about when
  you are working with <em>microservices</em>. These can range from how you
  communicate between the services? How do you handle a service going down? How
  to you monitor those services?
</p>
<p>
  One of the key things that stuck in my mind was
  <strong>what changes together, stays together!</strong> This means that each
  microservice has its own database, it owns its own data and is deployed with
  its own data. It also means that services are not a uniform size, they contain
  a whole <em>bounded context</em> rather than the Netflix "one microservice per
  table".
</p>
<p>
  Remember, it is OK to have a <em>monolith</em>. As I argued in the
  <a href="./2019-05-02-A-Monolith-Of-Microservices.html"
    >Monolith of Microservices</a
  >
  we can design a well-structured <em>monolith</em> and it is perfectly fine to
  use it and scale it until there is a specific need to extract services.

<h3>How to hack an election</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/garyshort">Gary Short</a></p>
<p>
  Gary talked about the tricks <em>"black hat data scientists"</em> use to
  influence how people vote.
</p>
<p>
  In the UK's electoral system, it is possible to target relatively few people
  in the most marginal seats to dramatically affect the results of the election.
  They can influence people to vote for quite extreme change by a range of
  techniques from convincing them that the current political situation is
  already broken (the <em>"broken window effect"</em>) to persuading them that
  their own lives suck so change can only make things better (the
  <em>"compensation effect"</em>)).
</p>
<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>

<h3>In retrospect</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/samhogy">Sam Hogarth</a></p>
<p>Sam believes, quite rightly, that <em>Agile</em> is not a solved problem!</p>
<p>
  The problem with a very prescriptive form of <em>Agile</em> is that we are
  losing out on a central pillar of agility, the fact that we should actually
  iterate to solve the specific problems that we face. There is no
  "one-size-fits-all" solution and we should not be trusting anyone who sells us
  a "silver bullet" but rather the people who coach us to solve our own
  problems.
</p>
<p>
  Sam believes that they key to true agility is in
  <em>do-measure-review-retrospect</em> cycle, which appears in many variations
  in different environments, e.g. the
  <em>Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (O.O.D.A.)</em> method of the military. When
  explaining in military terms, Sam explained if you move through the
  <em>O.O.D.A</em> loop faster than the competition, you adapt faster to change,
  gain an advantage and you disrupt the competition going through their own
  loop.
</p>
<p>
  So, the Retrospective is where we look back at what we have done, or rather
  how we have done it. We gather the information, we dig into the root causes
  (e.g. the "5 why's" technique) and decide how to improve.
</p>
<p>
  Another key point is to keep changing the format of your retrospective,
  otherwise they become stale, the same issues keep arising and everyone is
  disengaged.
