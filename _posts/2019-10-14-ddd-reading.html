<p>
  I attended the <em>DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper! 14</em> conference in Reading.
  The <strong>DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper!</strong> series of events are free,
  community-driven events that are held around the country and on a Saturday to
  allow as many people as possible to attend.

<h3>Serverless Architectural Patterns</h3>
<p>by Sana Sarjahani</p>

<p>
  Sana guided us through the myriad of possibilities in the serverless world
  before going through some best practices for working in the servless world.
</p>

<p>
  Some of my key takeaways were that we should avoid systems that are connected
  to each other by using ways to decouple the serverless functions (e.g. queues,
  message brokers). We should also ensure that we invest in logging as this is
  key to understanding what is going on in serverless systems.
</p>

<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>

<h3>Reading Matters for .NET Developers</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesw0rld">James World</a></p>

<p>
  James is an avid reader, he loves reading, he also believes that reading is
  one of the best ways to learn. He believes that, as professionals, we should
  not only learn about our tooling but we should learn about the theory of
  computer science and beyond that, understand how business works, how finance
  works, about the domains we work in.
</p>

<p>
  However, it is not just about reading books, its about how you read the book,
  he recommended
  <a

    >How to read a book</a
  >
  and talked through the various ways we can approach reading. We can get a
  flavour for the book by looking at the index, the foreward, the first and last
  paragraphs of chapters, this helps us to filter out whether the book is
  something that we want to read. As we read the book, we should ask ourselves
  questions about whether we agree, and if we are still interested we should not
  take this book as gospel, we should do research and read other material on the
  topic.

<h3>Azure IoT Hubs</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/pete_codes">Pete Gallagher</a></p>

<p>
  Pete gave us a great introduction to using the Azure IoT Hubs to create
  connected devices.
</p>
<p>
  I liked the way Pete started out by just providing the circuits work before
  trying to connect up to the cloud, we often forget to break down the problems
  we are trying to solve and this was a good reminder.
</p>
<p>
  Another great piece of advice from Pete was to ensure that every time you are
  testing things on Azure is to create a new <em>Resource Group</em> for the
  test, once you are done it is easier to delete the whole resource group than
  trying to delete individual resources one at a time.
</p>
<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>

<h3>AR/VR for the .NET Developer</h3>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/davidezordan">Davide Zordan</a></p>

<p>
  Davide showed us some of the techniques he has learned working with AR/VR
  technologies. He is excited about the possibilites that these technologies
  open up, we have only just begun to explore these possibilities.
</p>

<p>
  Motion in the VR world can be hard to achieve, Davide shows us some techniques
  he uses to get around this, by using teleportation over actual motion.
</p>

<p>
  Davide's key takeaways were to test often in order to sort out performance
  issues that can be a cause of motion sickness. We should also test on the
  hardware as often as possible and aim for a full immersive experience,
  including voice access.
</p>
<p>Here are my sketchnotes:</p>
